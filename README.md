# Black & White modding tools

This is a project under development which aims to build a set of tools to write new challenges (stories) for the game Black & White developed by Lionhead Studios and released in 2001.
The final intent is to have an IDE capable of editing scripts with the help of landscape visualization to pick or show coordinates.

Current status
A tool to capable of converting CHL files to assembler language and viceversa has been made and works perfectly.

Next steps
Implement a parser for the Challenge Language.
