### My notes about how exception works ###

Exceptions allow to execute some code whenever a condition meets, even if the script execution is locked in a loop.
I guess the exception handler is executed on the same thread  of the script every N instructions.
An interesting aspect is that the exception handler code is embedded in the calling script, but it is skipped
from normal execution by a fixed JMP instruction.
Another notable thing is that the conditions are just normal test instructions within an infinite loop, so there
is no real callback mechanism. This means that exception handling consumes CPU time, so use it with care.

Exception handlers can be nested. An exception handler gets activated by EXCEPT and deactivated by ENDEXCEPT.
The EXCEPT instruction must specify the address of the first instruction of the exception handler.

Just after the ENDEXCEPT instruction must be placed the followings:
1) a fixed JMP to skip the subsequent exception handler code from normal execution;
2) the exception handler code;
3) the ITEREXCEPT instruction; this is used by the exception handler executor to know that the exception
   handler code is ended and must be executed again from the start in the future;
4) whatever instruction; the fixed JMP at point 1 must point here. If this handler was defined at script
   level, then this instruction is END.

There are 2 types of exception which buildup the handler code: "when" and "until".

The "when" exceptions are similar to "if" statements: they check a condition and execute or skip the subsequent
user defined statements.

The "until" exceptions let the programmer specify just a condition. The subsequent statements depend only on the
kind of the containing block. The complete statements are:
	PUSHB false
	SYS SET_WIDESCREEN
	SYS END_GAME_SPEED
	SYS END_DIALOGUE
	SYS END_CAMERA_CONTROL
	BRKEXCEPT
	JMP labelAfterITEREXCEPT

They first clear any camera or dialogue sequence, the BRKEXCEPT stops the exception handler, and the JMP breaks
the execution of the block in the main script (loop, camera, cinema or script). The SYS statements are added only
when required.

Exceptions can be defined at script level, in loops, camera blocks and cinema blocks.

One weird thing is how to understand the end of a "when" block. I guess it ends whenever one of the following is found:
- another "when" statement
- a "until" statement
- the statement that closes the current block

This implies that you cannot insert normal code just after a "when" block, but you can do it after "until" statements.
So, "when" blocks should appear at the end of the block, while "until" blocks may appear at any point.
"when" blocks may also appear at any point if they are followed by an "until" statement, but I don't recommend it,
doing so would produce a mess. Luckily I haven't found such cases in the original scripts.


## Examples ##

Consider the following code:

Repeat = 0
while Repeat < 100
	Repeat++
	when SomeVar == 2
		Repeat += 2
	when SomeVar == 3
		Repeat += 3
	until SomeVar == 4
end while


This is how it should be translated:
	
	//Repeat = 0
	PUSHF 0.0
	POPF [Repeat]
	//while Repeat < 100
	EXCEPT lblExceptionHandler
lblStartWhile:
	PUSHF [Repeat]
	PUSHF 100.0
	LT
	JZ lblEndWhile
		//while body
		//Repeat++
		PUSHF [Repeat]
		PUSHF 1.0
		ADD
		POPF Repeat
	//end while
	JMP lbllblStartWhile
lblEndWhile:
	ENDEXCEPT
	JMP lblEndExcept
lblExceptionHandler:
	//when SomeVar == 2
	PUSHF [SomeVar]
	PUSHF 2.0
	EQ
	JZ lblWhen2
		//Repeat += 2
		PUSHF [Repeat]
		PUSHF 2.0
		ADD
		POPF Repeat
lblWhen2:
	//when SomeVar == 3
	PUSHF [SomeVar]
	PUSHF 3.0
	EQ
	JZ lblUntil1
		//Repeat += 3
		PUSHF [Repeat]
		PUSHF 3.0
		ADD
		POPF Repeat
lblUntil1:
	//until SomeVar == 4
	PUSHF [SomeVar]
	PUSHF 4.0
	EQ
	JZ lblUntilNotMatched
	PUSHB false
	SYS SET_WIDESCREEN
	SYS END_GAME_SPEED
	SYS END_DIALOGUE
	SYS END_CAMERA_CONTROL
	BRKEXCEPT
	JMP lblEndExcept
lblUntilNotMatched:
	ITEREXCEPT
lblEndExcept:


The same code without any exception:

Repeat = 0
while Repeat < 100
	Repeat++
end while


Translates to:

	//Repeat = 0
	PUSHF 0.0
	POPF [Repeat]
	//while Repeat < 100
	EXCEPT lblExceptionHandler
lblStartWhile:
	PUSHF [Repeat]
	PUSHF 100.0
	LT
	JZ lblEndWhile
		//while body
		//Repeat++
		PUSHF [Repeat]
		PUSHF 1.0
		ADD
		POPF Repeat
	//end while
	JMP lbllblStartWhile
lblEndWhile:
	ENDEXCEPT
	JMP lblEndExcept
lblExceptionHandler:
	//Here would go the exception handlers
	ITEREXCEPT
lblEndExcept:
