This file contains a sample of all the CHL statements along with their translation
in assembler language. This will be used to implement the compiler.

TODO: add missing samples

### Structure of this document ###
Each statement is introduced by its chapter number and syntax taken from the
"Lionhead Challenge Language Documentation" released for Creature Isle; in some cases the syntax
has been fixed accordingly to real statements found in the original script files taken from B&W for Mac.
On the subsequent line there is the description of the statement.
On the subsequent line there is a real statement extracted from the script files cited above.
The subsequent lines are the equivalent assembler code decompiled using this tool and
located with hard research work. Note that the current CHL has been patched by LH, while the scripts
available to us are at the original version, so not all statements have an exact match with the
decompiled code.
Statements are ordered by chapter number.
Some complex statements may have additional info to help understand their implementation.

2.5.1 run script IDENTIFIER[(parameters)]

Auto-run declarations are used to specify any scripts which are to be run immediately upon start-up.
You will probably want to run all of the challenges this way, as the challenge scripts may simply wait
until a certain condition is satisfied before they begin proper.

run script ChallengeHighlightNotify(Highlight, VillagerHutPos, variable EVIL_ADVISOR, variable HELP_TEXT_GENERAL_CHALLENGE_START_03)

	PUSHF [Highlight]
	PUSHF [VillagerHutPos]

When dealing with spirits, it is often not desirable to create objects to refer to them. You can
refer to a spirit directly by using its SPIRIT_TYPE. This command makes the specified spirit appear,
if necessary, and then point to the target object.
