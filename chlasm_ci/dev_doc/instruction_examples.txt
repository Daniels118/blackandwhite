This file contains a sample of all the CHL statements along with their translation
in assembler language. This will be used to implement the compiler.

### Structure of this document ###
Each statement is introduced by its chapter number and syntax taken from the
"Lionhead Challenge Language Documentation" released for Creature Isle; in some cases the syntax
has been fixed accordingly to real statements found in the original script files taken from B&W for Mac,
and I have also added some missing statements.
On the subsequent line there is the description of the statement taken from the same document.
On the subsequent line there is a real statement extracted from the script files cited above. In some
cases the statement has been simplified to focus on the relevant part.
The subsequent lines are the equivalent assembler code decompiled using this tool and
located with hard research work.
Statements are ordered by chapter number.
Some complex statements may have additional info to help understand their implementation.

### Notes ###
All SWAP instructions could be avoided by coding the arguments in the proper order. This could be
a chance for an optimization option. I think this was needed because the original parser gave no
way of controlling the visit order of the AST.

All variable assignment are preceded by a "PUSH [var], POPI", which I think is useless.
The same happens with SET_PROPERTY. Removing these useless instructions could be a chance for an
optimization. I think this was due to how the original parser worked.

The implementation of 3.18.23 looks bugged.

___________________________________________

### 2.2 challenge IDENTIFIER

At any point in a Challenge Language file, you may optionally specify the name of the challenge.
This allows the game to identify which challenge the subsequent statements within the file correspond to.
Various statements may use this information (i.e. snapshot, highlight, and camera paths).
Be aware that the identifier needs to be defined in the header file ScriptChallengeEnums.h prefixed by
"CHALLENGE_". Camera paths such as T00_000 must be defined with the challenge name as prefix.

challenge ALLY_SPEAKS

No code.

### 2.5 Scripts
___________________________________________

2.5.1 run script IDENTIFIER[(PARAMETERS)]

Auto-run declarations are used to specify any scripts which are to be run immediately upon start-up.
You will probably want to run all of the challenges this way, as the challenge scripts may simply wait
until a certain condition is satisfied before they begin proper.

run script ChallengeHighlightNotify(Highlight, VillagerHutPos, variable EVIL_ADVISOR, variable HELP_TEXT_GENERAL_CHALLENGE_START_03)

	PUSHF [Highlight]
	PUSHF [VillagerHutPos]
	PUSHI 2
	CASTF
	PUSHI 2696
	CASTF
	CALL ChallengeHighlightNotifyWithEndVariable
___________________________________________

2.5.4.1 IDENTIFIER = EXPRESSION

Amount = 250/(BaywatchSwimmingCounter)		//#baywatch.txt:13

	PUSHF [Amount]		//*These instructions seem useless, I would remove them
	POPI				//*
	PUSHF 250.0
	PUSHF [BaywatchSwimmingCounter]
	DIV
	POPF Amount
___________________________________________
	
2.5.7 end script IDENTIFIER

end script VortexEntryPerson

	END

When dealing with spirits, it is often not desirable to create objects to refer to them. You can
refer to a spirit directly by using its HELP_SPIRIT_TYPE. This command makes the specified spirit appear,
if necessary, and then point to the target object.
